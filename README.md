# CimaP3 - MP3 converter
### This is `for educational purposes only`

This little project aims to teach how to use ffmpeg to convert stream files into mp3 in the node environment, learn basic use of front-end framworks(React.js), and setup a basic server with the express.js framework.  

Aims for the next month:


 - Add offline-support using service workers to convert mp4 to mp3 without the need of the server.
 - Improve conversions speed.
 - Add video download
 - Add soundcloud support.
 - Improve and add responsive UI(OMG NOW!!)

If any wants to become a collaborator feel free to contact me or fork this project :)
